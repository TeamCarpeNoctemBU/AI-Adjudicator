       "[(Pixar has announced that it is working on sequels to The Incredibles and Cars 2.  Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed the news while speaking at the company shareholder meeting in Portland, Oregon.  No details of storyline or release dates have been revealed for the upcoming films.  The studio is also working on a Finding Nemo sequel, Finding Dory, as well as The Good Dinosaur and Inside Out.  However, with Finding Dory and The Good Dinosaur both being pushed back, 2014 will be Pixar first year without releasing a feature film since 2005.  The delays mean the gap between Pixar most recent release, Monsters University, and Inside Out is the longest period they've gone without a new movie since the original Incredibles  was followed by Cars in June 2006.  The most recent film in the Cars franchise, Cars 2, was released in 2011.  Pixar has also announced that a 3D version of 2007 Ratatouille is planned.  Toy Story and Toy Story 2 have previously been re released in 3D, as well as Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc.  Meanwhile, Disney and Lucasfilm have confirmed filming for Star Wars: Episode VII will start shooting at Pinewood Studios near London in May.  An online statement added that the latest instalment in the series would be set about 30 years after the events of Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.  The film, directed by JJ Abrams, is set to be released in cinemas on 18 December 2015.  Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter,\n",
