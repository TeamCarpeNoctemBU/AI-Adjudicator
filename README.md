# HackaccinoProject22
Ok so we're making this project based on AI/ML where we will be using it to see if a person really has
deserved what is coming for them from the DC

we will use text testinomies from the accused, witness and the person who will adjudging the perps

we will later go on to check if the accused's story matches up with that of the accounts and 
see if it is consistent using a lie detector to fish out incosistencies and state them, it will be 
question based, and each time the field will be reset

we will also set boundaries for what can be considered under the DC to be a punishable offence,
and then based off of that we decide if they deserve punishment

person can only backspace in word and cannot move to previous words

decides if the person is guilty or no 

complaints forum
